Through this initiative, we hope to promote global data standards and serve as a data bridge among all the global supply chain community stakeholders and digital platforms. 
Leveraging on digitalOCEANS™, we hope to enable true system-to-system interoperability that goes beyond form-based submissions. 

As more global digital platforms come online, digitalOCEANS™ will also serve as a conduit for global connectivity by facilitating information flows, data exchange and end-to-end services for port calls and marine services.
