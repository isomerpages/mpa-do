Digital OCEANS is envisioned to be an interoperable super-platform and information hub that facilitates cross-border data exchange and automated services across supply chain players, clearance authorities and other national single windows.

Through this platform, we hope to promote global data standards and serve as a data bridge among all the global supply chain community stakeholders and platforms. 
Leveraging on Digital OCEANS, we hope to enable true system-to-system interoperability that goes beyond form-based submissions. 

As more global digital platforms come online, Digital OCEANS will also serve as a conduit for global connectivity by facilitating information flows, data exchange and end-to-end services for port calls.
