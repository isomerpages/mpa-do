As a prologue to the Maritime Perspectives series, this webinar will focus on how the industry can come together to achieve efficiency and interoperability across different maritime platforms / systems in the new normal. We will also witness the signing of an MoU on common data standards and API specifications.

Since 2019, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Facilitation (FAL) Convention has made the electronic exchange of information for clearance processes in ports mandatory. With the rise in adoption and usage of electronic platforms, and to address the growing need for interoperability across maritime platforms, MPA is spearheading a rallying call for platform-providers, port authorities and shipping representatives to converge towards common data standards and data exchange via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

The MoU signing will feature six partners, with more to come onboard. This MoU marks the beginning of our quest to bring on more partners as we work together towards concrete deliverables on data harmonisation and API specifications development for seamless data exchange across global partners.
