<p>During Smart Port Challenge (SPC) 2021 Grand Finals on 23rd November 2021, Singaporeâ€™s Senior Minister of State for Transport, Mr Chee Hong Tat, announced the launch of the Application Programming Interface (API) specifications for port clearance under the digitalOCEANSTM initiative. This will enable ship operators and other supply chain players to enjoy smoother port clearances at ports that adopt the API specifications for submission of information. Start-ups and other MarineTech players can also tailor their products to utilise this set of API specifications to develop port clearance related solutions, and potentially expand their market reach to more ports and shipping lines, including supply chain companies.</p>
