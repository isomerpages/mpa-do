<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

The objective of the digitalOCEANS<sup><font style="font-size: 0.7em;">TM</font></sup> Port Clearance API specifications is to standardise the technical implementation for port clearance related data between data consumers and providers. This would steamline the implementation efforts by port authorities and the industry to enable interoperability between various systems.

Building on the IMO Compendium on Facilitation and Electronic Business, this specification lists the APIs to be implemented for both data consumers and providers to effectively exchange these data elements.
